# Welcome to Frank's blog :)

Recently I've been thinking about to share something I've learned or thought about software engineering, coding, and technical stuffs, so I setup this page.

Although not much can be seen now, I'm gonna add more content here.

If you have any advice or suggestion, **which will be really appreciated**, please [mail me](mailto:frankwu101@outlook.com).

Hope you guys like my posts!
